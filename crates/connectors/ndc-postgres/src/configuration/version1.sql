-- This query introspects the relations and types defined in the connected
-- database using the system catalog tables in the `pg_catalog` namespace.
--
-- The data model of these tables is quite involved and carries with it decades
-- of legacy. Supporting notes on this are kept in 'introspection-notes.md'.
--
-- TODO: This uses unqualified table (and view) and constraint names.
--       We will need to qualify them at some point. This makes the aliases seem
--       redundant, but they will change in the future.
--       If similar named tables exist in different schemas it is arbitrary
--       which one we pick currently! (c.f. Citus schemas 'columnar' and
--       'columnar_internal' which both have a 'chunk' table)

-- When debugging in 'psql', uncomment the lines below to be able to run the
-- query with arguments set.

WITH
  -- The overall structure of this query is a CTE (i.e. 'WITH .. SELECT')
  -- statement which define projections of the catalog tables into forms that are
  -- more convenient to work with:
  --
  -- * We project only the columns that we need for constructing the ndc instance
  --   schema and serving queries, and we try apply consistent naming.
  --
  -- * We resolve references (oid's) to names.
  --
  -- * We avoid aggregations over sub-selects and lateral joins since those have
  --   proven brittle across postgres variants by experience. Instead we use
  --   regular joins over tables that have been grouped by the join key to ensure
  --   the 1:1 correspondance.
  --
  -- One benefit of using a CTE is that it's easy to experiment with the query,
  -- as you can query each of the WITH-bound sub-queries independently in the
  -- main statement.
