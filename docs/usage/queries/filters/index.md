# PostgreSQL: Filter Query Results / Search Queries

## Introduction

Hasura provides a powerful yet simple syntax to filter query results on PostgreSQL. This is useful for building search
queries or filtering data based on some criteria. You can utilize arguments and operators to filter results based on
equality, comparison, pattern matching, etc.

## The **where** argument

You can use the `where` argument in your queries to filter results based on some fieldâ€™s values (even nested objects'
fields). You can even use multiple filters in the same `where` clause using the `_and` or the `_or` operators.

For example, to fetch data for an author whose name is "Sidney":

```graphql {3}
query {
  authors(where: { name: { _eq: "Sidney" } }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

You can also use nested objects' fields to filter rows from a table and also filter the nested objects as well.

For example, to fetch a list of authors who have articles with a rating greater than 4 along with those articles:

```graphql {2,5}
query {
  authors(where: { articles: { rating: { _gt: 4 } } }) {
    id
    name
    articles(where: { rating: { _gt: 4 } }) {
      id
      title
      rating
    }
  }
}
```

Here `_eq` and `_gt` are examples of comparison operators that can be used in the `where` argument to filter on
equality.
